## Core Concepts of Data Mining

1. **Classification:** Assigning items in a dataset to predefined categories based on attributes.  
2. **Clustering:** Grouping similar items together without predefined labels.  
3. **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between variables, e.g., market basket analysis.  
4. **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual or suspicious patterns in data.  
5. **Regression Analysis:** Predicting numerical outcomes based on historical data.
